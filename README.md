# Peter Terminal Utilities

This repository contains lots of miscellaneous files that I use to quickly set up a new computer with the essentials. These aren't strictly all terminal-related, but I'm grouping them together so that they're all easy to find.

This is a non-maintained repository and is public mostly just so I can share with friends/colleagues; please be patient if I don't respond to pull requests or issues.
